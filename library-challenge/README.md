# Library Challenge

This README file is written in markdown, so if you're reading it in raw text but wanna see it all souped up and nice looking
then check it out at https://github.com/silas-hw/as-tkinter/blob/main/library-challenge/README.md

## User Passwords

This app uses hashing to keep passwords secure. However. this means whoever has to test it (aka you) won't be able to
find out what the passwords are by looking at the users file. So here they are:

|   username    |   password    |
|---------------|---------------|
| user123       | password123   |
| Steph         | StephIsCool56 |
